# PyConLt2019Talk at PyConLT 2019 (May, 26, 2019 11:00)https://www.pycon.lt/## Geodata processing using Python and JupyterHubGeospatial data is data containing a spatial component – describing objects with a reference to the planet's surface.This data usually consists of a spatial component, of various attributes, and sometimes of a time reference (where, what, and when). Efficient processing and visualization of small to large-scale spatial data is a challenging task. This talk describes how to process and visualize **geospatial vector and raster data** using Python and the Jupyter Notebook. There are numerous modules available which help using geospatial data in using low- and high-level interfaces. We will look at **shapely**, which is used for manipulation and analysis of geometric objects. Then we go further to **Fiona** – a module which handles geospatial vector data in a very pythonic way. We move on to raster data processing using the **rasterio** module and briefly look at the **pyproj** module which is used for transforming spatial reference systems.After that we look at **GeoPandas** which is basically an extended pandas module with support for geodata. At the end we will see how maps are created using the **cartopy** and **folium** modules. In addition, some examples are shown how to use deep learning for raster analysis using a GPU cluster.
